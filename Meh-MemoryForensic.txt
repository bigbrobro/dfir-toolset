--Preparation in advance--

IOC repo collection
Hash repo if offline is required
Tools thumbdrive/DVD and sterilized storage

--Items run on a Windows OS--

Memory image capture (online)
Disk image capture (offline)
FTK for application artifacts (offline)

--Items run on a Linux OS offline--

Volatility shotgun - check for common scenarios
  Create pstree -v output
  Create/Check schtasks module output
  Create/sort shimcachemem by date
  Check malfind processes
  Check for services without drivers
  Find processes with FALSE in psxview
  View cmdline/consoles for manual activity
  Check shellbags for MRU's
Run bulk_extractor to more quickly pull pcaps from images

Collected IOC scans: IP, URL, domain, scraped hashes 

File scraping
  clamscan
  Pull logs based on running apps
  extract application logs
  Check for unsigned signatures of libraries
  missidentify to find renamed exe's
  Generate md5/fuzzy hashes for pre-examination
  Hash scans against VT or localized repo
  Entropy checks
  Check for suspicious remote sites in netscan

Deobfuscation techniques (when to use)
Java analysis
Javascript analysis

Test against strings

Analyze Windows metadata (hachoir / exif dump)
  Does FTK do this well since you use it already?

Document Analysis (pdf, Office, etc)

Unpacking PE/DLL
Dynamic malware analysis
Static malware analysis

-- pcap analysis --

Trim to include only suspect IP to start
Networkminer to quick look at binaries
Scan any upfront suspicious binaries
Analyze sessions and theorize based on traffic protocols and contents
Check http for malicious JS routines looking for encoded routines
Shellcode analysis
Attempt SSL decode for encrypted traffic?
Locate external actors
