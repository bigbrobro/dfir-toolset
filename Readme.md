I spent most my prior life as a 'nix administrator. As part of the DFIR crowd that fosters sharing, this has been my live documentation that I edit as I learn more and as reorganize.  Output here is the absorbed and restructured data from various sources to make sense through all the noise in the way I operate.  Besides techniques and procedures, my toolset list focuses on the broad spectrum of tools to perform forensics on Windows and Linux systems.  Mac on the horizon to start.
  
It'll mature over time.
